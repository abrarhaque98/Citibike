# Citibike Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis
For this project the objective was to visualize citibike data in NYC using tableau to provide insights for a business proposal to create a similar ride sharing system in Des Moines, Iowa. The Citibike data for the month of August in 2019 was taken from the citibike website and was used for the visualization. Several visualizations such as checkout time for users, checkout times by gender, trips by weekday for each hour, trips by gender by weekday per hour, user trips by gender, top starting and ending locations were presented in a tableau story.

### Results

The visualization above displays the **Checkout Times for Users**, the 0/1/2 charts indicate the hours along with the minutes inside the graphs. It appears that a majority of checkout times were under 1 hour.

The visualization above is the **Checkout Times by Gender** similar to that of the **Checkout Times for Users** except with the filtering by gender. It appears that males outnumbered the other genders significantly in terms of trip counts by checkout duration.

The visualization above displays **Trips by Weekday for Each Hour**, with a heat map visualizing count of trips throughout the hours of the weekdays. The color schema goes from gold (low relative ride count) to dark red (high relative ride count). It can be seen that between the hours of 7am - 9am and 5pm - 7pm ride on Monday through Friday the count was relatively high, these are typically realized as commuting hours since most individuals work a 9-5 M-F.

The visualization above displays **Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)** similar to the previous visualization before it with a heat map displaying ride count throughout the weekdays by the hour but also filtering for Gender. The ride counts for the previously mentioned popular commuting hours and overall use are predominantly men.

The visualization above displays **User Trips by Gender by Weekday**, visualizing the user type of customer / subscriber by gender. The ride count of subscribers for Females and Males outnumber that of customer user types. Males are still seen to be using the bikes more consistently throughout the week under the subscriber usertype, while other combinations vary.

The visualizations above display **Top Starting Locations and Top Ending Locations**, the locations are visualized by size of ride count from each location and a color scheme for more visual clarity. It can be seen that the majority of starting and ending location counts were within Manhattan. 

### Summary 
In summary the visualization provides insight into several factors of NYC citibike business. 
* Most bikes in the month of August were checked out for under an hour.
* Men make up the majority of bike users.
* The prime hours for bike checkouts seem to be between commuting hours on weekdays and leisure hours on weekends. 
* Most of the trips were within Manhattan although there were locations in Brooklyn, and Queens. 

For a deeper understanding and further insight into NYC's Citibike business further visualizations could be performed, one being providing similar visualizations on citibike data for another month of the year particularly the winter to measure activity and profitability within the less popular months. 
Another visualization if possible would be to map popular starting and ending points against alternative modes of transportation such as trains / buses. This visualization would allow a comparison to see whether the bikes were chosen as a preference over other modes of transportation or as a convenience because no other alternative modes of transportation were available. From a glance a lot of the hot starting and ending points were along side the west side of Manhattan where fewer train and bus options are available. Many also go into midtown Manhattan which populates a large amount of Manhattans work force.
