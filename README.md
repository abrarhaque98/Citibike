# Citibike Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis
For this project the objective was to visualize citibike data in NYC using tableau to provide insights for a business proposal to create a similar ride sharing system in Des Moines, Iowa. The Citibike data for the month of August in 2019 was taken from the citibike website and was used for the visualization. Several visualizations such as checkout time for users, checkout times by gender, trips by weekday for each hour, trips by gender by weekday per hour, user trips by gender, top starting and ending locations were presented in a tableau story. 

### Results

The visualization above displays the **Checkout Times for Users**, the 0/1/2 charts indicate the hours along with the minutes inside the graphs. It appears that a majority of checkout times were under 1 hour.

The visualization above is the **Checkout Times by Gender** similar to that of the **Checkout Times for Users** except with the filtering by gender. It appears that males outnumbered the other genders significantly in terms of trip counts by checkout duration.

The visualization above displays **Trips by Weekday for Each Hour**, with a heat map visualizing count of trips throughout the hours of the weekdays. The color schema goes from gold (low relative ride count) to dark red (high relative ride count). It can be seen that between the hours of 7am - 9am and 5pm - 7pm ride on Monday through Friday the count was relatively high, these are typically realized as commuting hours since most individuals work a 9-5 M-F.

The visualization above displays **Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)** similar to the previous visualization before it with a heat map displaying ride count throughout the weekdays by the hour but also filtering for Gender. The ride counts for the previously mentioned popular commuting hours and overall use are predominantly men.

The visualization above displays **User Trips by Gender by Weekday**, visualizing the user type of customer / subscriber by gender. The ride count of subscribers for Females and Males outnumber that of customer user types. Males are still seen to be using the bikes more consistently throughout the week under the subscriber usertype, while other combinations vary.
